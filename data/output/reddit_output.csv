1k2e68y,Some of you aren't writing tests. Start writing tests.,"[This came to my attention in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) One of \*the big things\* that separates a data analyst from a data engineer, imo, is whether or not you're capable of testing your code. There's a lot of learners around here right now so I'm going to write this for your benefit. I hope it helps!

# Caveat

I am not a data engineer. I am a PM for data systems, was a data analyst in my previous life, and have worked with some very good senior contributors and architects. I've learned a lot from them and owe a lot of my career success to their lessons.

I am going to try to pass on the little that I know. If you know better than I do, pop into the comments below and feel free to yell at me.

Also, testing is a wide, varied field, this is a brief synopsis, definitely do more reading on your own.

# When do I need to test my code?

Data transformations happen in a lot of different ways. When you work with small data, you might write an excel macro, or a quick little script for manipulation. Not writing tests for these is largely fine, especially when it's something **you** do just for **your** work. Coding in isolation can benefit from tests, but it's not the primary concern.

You really need to start thinking about writing tests when two things happen:

1. People that are not you start touching your code
2. The code you write becomes part of a complex system

The exception to these two rules is when you're creating portfolio projects. You should write tests for these, because they make you look smart to your interviewers.

# Why do I need to test my code?

Tests take **implicit** knowledge & context about the purpose of your code / what it does and makes that knowledge **explicit**.

This is required to help other people start using the code that you write - if they're new to it, the tests help them understand the purpose of each function and give them guard rails as they make changes.

When your code becomes incorporated into a larger system, this is particularly true - it's more likely you'll have multiple folks working with you, and other things that are happening elsewhere in the system might necessitate making changes to your code.

# What types of tests are there?

I can name at least 4 different types of tests off the dome. There are more but I'm typing extemporaneously and not for clout, so you get what's in my memory:

* Unit tests - these test small, discrete parts of your code.
   * Example: in your pipeline, you write a small function that lowercases names and strips certain characters. You need this to work in a predictable manner, so you write a unit test for it.
* Integration tests - these test the boundaries between different functions to make sure the output of one feeds the input of the other correctly.
   * Example: in your pipeline, one function extracts the data from an API, and another takes that extracted data and does a transform. An integration test would examine whether the output of the first function results is correct for the second.
* End-to-end tests - these test whether, given a correct input, the whole of your code produces the correct output. These are hard, but the more of these you can do, the better off you'll be.
   * Example: you have a pipeline that reads data from an API and inserts it into your database. You mock out a fake input and run your whole pipeline against it, then verify that the expected output is in the database.
* Data validation tests - these test whether the data you're being passed, or the data that's landing in a given system, are of the expected shape and type.
   * Example: your pipeline expects a json blob that has strings in it. Data validation tests would ensure that, once extracted or placed in a holding area, the data is both a json blob with the correct keys and the data types for those keys are all strings

# How do I write tests?

This is already getting longer than I have patience for, it's Friday at 4pm, so again, you're going to get some crib notes.

Whatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability. SQL does not, unfortunately - it's why you tend to wrap SQL in a different programming language like Python. If you only have SQL, some of what I write below won't apply - you're most likely only doing end-to-end or data validation testing.

Start by writing functional tests. For each function in your code, write at least one positive case (where it gets the correct input) and one negative case (where it's given a bad input that might break it).

Try to anticipate ways in which your functions might fail. Encode those into your test cases. If you encounter new and exciting ways in which your code breaks as you work, write more tests for those cases.

Your development process should become an endless litany of writing code, then writing tests, then testing, then breaking, then writing more tests, then writing more code, and so on in an endless loop.

Once you've got a whole pipeline running, write integration tests for the handoffs between your functions. Same thing applies as above. You might need to do some mocking - look that up. 

End-to-end tests - you might need more complex testing techniques for this, or frameworks. If you have a webapp over your data, you can try something like Selenium. Otherwise, not my forte, consult your seniors. You might also need to set up a test environment with some test data. It's expensive time-wise, but this is why we write infrastructure as code (learn that also, if you can).

Data validation tests - if you're writing in SQL, use DBT. If you're writing in Python, use Great Expectations. If you're writing in something else, I can't help you, not my forte, consult your seniors.

Happy Friday folks, hope this helped!

1k2pvc3,Stay in Data Engineering vs Switch to Full Stack?,"I am currently a Data Engineer and recently got an opportunity to switch to full stack, what do you think? 

Background: In the US. 1 year Data Engineer, 2 years of Data Analytics. While I seem to have some years of data experience, the experience gained from the Data Analytics role was more business than technical, so I consider myself with 1 year of technical experience.  

Data Engineer (current role): 

\- Current company: 500 people in financial services

\- Tech Stack: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Spark

\- While my team does have a lot of traditional data engineering work like building data pipelines, data modelling etc, my focus over the past year has always been building internal AI applications, from building mechanism to ingest different types of data into datalake, creating vector database, building RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, creating resources on the cloud, to backend and small amount of front end development. 

\- Potentially less saturated and more in-demand in the future given AI?

\- While my interest is more in building AI applications and less about writing SQL, not sure if this will impact my job search in the future if future employers want someone with strong SQL, Spark experience, traditional data engineering experience? 



Full Stack Engineer (potential switch):

\- MNC (10000+) in tier-one consulting company 

\- Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, React, Svelte, AWS, Azure

\- Focus will be on full stack development on a wide diversity of internal projects that emphasise building zero-to-one kind of web apps for internal stakeholders.  

\- I am interested in building new things from ground up, so this role seems to be more interesting

\- May give me more relevant skills to build new business in the future potentially? 

\- May be more saturated in the future given AI?

Very new to the iceberg space so please tell me if there’s something obvious here.

After reading many many post on the web I found out that people agree that Spark is a better transformation engine while Trino is a better query engine.

People seem to use both and I don’t understand why after reading so many different things.

It seems like what comes back is that Spark is more than just a transformation engine, and you can use it for a bunch of other stuff. What are those other stuff and does it still apply if you have a proper orchestrator ?

Why would people take the time and effort to support 2 tools, 2 query engine, 2 configs if it’s just for a couple more increase in performance using Spark va Trino?

Maybe I’m missing the big point here. Is the increase in performance so high than it’s not worth just doing it in Trino ? And then if that’s the case is Spark so bad a ad-hoc query that it cannot replace Trino for most of the company because it’s very painful to use SparkSQL?

1k2wufq,How are you guys testing your code on the cloud with limited access?,"The code at our application is poorly covered by test cases. A big part of that is that we don't have access on our work computers to a lot of what we need to test.

At our company, access to the cloud is very heavily guarded. A lot of what we need is hosted on that cloud, specially secrets for DB connections and S3 access. These things cannot be accessed from our laptops and are only availble when the code is already running on EMR.

A lot of what we do test depends on those inccessible parts so we just mock a good response but I feel that that is meaning part of the point of the test, since we are not testing that the DB/S3 parts are working properly.

I want to start building a culture of always including tests, but until the access part is realsolved, I do not think the other DE will comply.

How are you guys testing your DB code when the DB is inaccessible locally? Keep in mind, that we cannot just have a local DB as that would require a lot of extra maintenance and manual synching of the DBs, more over, the dummy DB would need to be accesible in the CICD pipeline building the code, so it must easily portable (we actually tried this, by using DuckDB as the local DB but had issues with it, maybe I will post about that on another thread).

Set up:
Cloud - AWS
Running Env - EMR
DB - Aurora PG
Language - Scala
Test Liv - ScalaTest + Mockito

The main blockers:
No access Secrets
No access to S3
No access to AWS CLI to interact with S3
Whatever solution, must be light weight
Solution must be fully storable in same repo
Solution must be triggerable in CICD pipeline.


BTW, i believe that the CI/CD pipeline has full access to AWS, the problem is enabling testing on our laptops and then the same setup must work on the CICD pipeline.

1k2exrn,GizmoEdge - a Distributed IoT SQL Engine,"# 🚀 Introducing GizmoEdge: Distributed SQL Powered by IoT Devices!

Hi Reddit 👋,

I'm **Philip Moore** — founder of **GizmoData**, and creator of **GizmoEdge** — a *Distributed SQL Engine* powered by *Internet-of-Things (IoT)* devices. 🌎📡

# 🔥 What is GizmoEdge?

**GizmoEdge** is a **prototype application** that lets you run **SQL queries distributed across multiple devices** — including:

* 🐧 Linux
* 🍎 macOS
* 📱 iOS / iPadOS
* 🐳 Kubernetes Pods
* 🍓 Raspberry Pis
* ... and more!

I've built a **front-end app** where you can issue distributed SQL queries right now:  
👉 [https://gizmoedge.gizmodata.com](https://gizmoedge.gizmodata.com/)

# 📲 Want to Join the Collective?

If you have an **Apple device**, you can install the **GizmoEdge Worker** app here:  
👉 [Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gizmoedge/id6738658135)

# ✨ How it Works:

* Install the app.
* Connect it to the running GizmoEdge server (super easy — just tap the little blue *server* icon next to the GizmoData logo!).
* Credentials are **pre-filled** — just click the **""Connect WebSocket""** button! 🛜
* The app downloads a shard of **TPC-H** data (\~1GB footprint, compressed as **Parquet** in a **ZStandard** `.tar.zst` file).
* It builds a **DuckDB** database locally.
* 🔥 *While the app is open and in the foreground*, your device becomes an active **worker** participating in distributed SQL queries!

When you issue SQL queries via the app at [gizmoedge.gizmodata.com](https://gizmoedge.gizmodata.com/), your device will help execute them (if connected and ready)!

# 🔒 Tech Stack Highlights

* **Workers:** DuckDB 🦆
